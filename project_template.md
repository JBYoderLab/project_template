*Devonport*

Boisterous weather, the ship rolled a good deal; & I actually felt rather uncomfortable: I look forward to sea-sickness with utter dismay, not so much as regards the misery of a fortnight or three weeks, as the being incapacitated for a much longer time from any active employment. — In middle of day walked to Corsan (Cawsand) bay & there enjoyed the sight of the sea lashing itself & foaming on the rocks. --- There is no pleasure, equal to that which fine scenery & exercise creates. It is to this I look forward to with more enthusiasm than any other part of our voyage.

Dined with Sir Manley Dixon, a pleasant quiet party, or rather to speak more truly, I suspect very dull to every body but the Captain & myself, for the Beagle was the chief subject of conversation, & it is now the only one that at all interests me. — It is no easy matter at any time, but now a most painful one to make conversation at a regular party.

We have had a long & rough pull to the vessel, but I am now seated in my own corner, snug & am listening to the wind roaring through the rigging with same sort of feeling that I often have when sitting round a Christmas fire.

Eight bells have struck, or it is 12 oclock, so I will turn into my hammock.

*Devonport to Canary Islands*

In the morning very uncomfortable; got up about noon and enjoyed some few moments of comparative ease. A shoal of porpoises dashing round the vessel and a stormy petrel skimming over the waves were the first objects of interest I have seen. I spent a very pleasant afternoon lying on the sofa, either talking to the Captain or reading Humboldt glowing accounts of tropical scenery. Nothing could be better adapted for cheering the heart of a sea-sick man.
